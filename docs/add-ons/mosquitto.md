# Eclipse Mosquitto

[Eclipse Mosquitto][1] is an open source (EPL/EDL licensed) message broker that implements the MQTT protocol. 

The MQTT protocol provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for Internet of Things messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers, or microcontrollers.
