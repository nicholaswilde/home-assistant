## :computer: Intel NUC

I used to run HA on a bare-metal NUC running Ubuntu Server, but a lot of computing potential was wasted on the NUC.

## ![rpi](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/png/raspberry-pi.png){ width="24" } [Raspberry Pi 4 8GB][12]

I have since moved over to a dedicated Raspberry Pi 4 8GB running Raspberry Pi OS. This, too, may be underutilized.

This is a repurposed Raspberry Pi.

## ![ha](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/png/home-assistant.png){ width="24" } [Home Assistant Yellow][21]

I know that that the Home Assistant Yellow exists, but just haven't looked into it.
