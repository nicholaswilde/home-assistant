# :robot: Automations

Automations that I use.

## :bulb: Lighting

The vast majority of my automations consist of controlling lights around the house.

### :door: Closet & Pantry

Because my closet and pantry are dark, I need to turn on a light every time I open the doors. 

I have a zigbee or z-wave light switch that contols the light inside of the room so it can be manually turned on and off.

I have a recessed z-wave door sensor that senses when the door is opened, which then turns on the light.

the light is also turned off when the door is closed again.

The problem with this method is that the door sensor runs on a CR2 battery, which needs to be replaced every once in a while.

I can't get my low battery notifications to be consistent and so I rely on observations of when the light doesn't change to tell me that the battery needs to be changed.

I do use rechargeable CR2 batteries, which makes it more manageable.
